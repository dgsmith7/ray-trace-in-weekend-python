# ray-trace-in-weekend-python

This repo is my Python implemenetation of this project:

https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

The project repo is "tagged" at each milestone. To see a list of tag names and their commit messages, type this at terminal:

`git tag -n`

To view the state of the repo at that milestone type this at terminal:

`git checkout <tagname>`

To run the program simply type this at terminal, assuming you have python3 installed:

`python3 main.py`

Enjoy. What a fun and informative project!!!
