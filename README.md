# ray-trace-in-weekend-python

This repo is my Python implemenetation of this project. I followed the book, translating into python as I went along, with some help from GitHub Copilot and a whole lot of digging into the Pyhon Docs. I have learned a lot about Ray Tracers and a lot about Python along the way.:

The project repo is "tagged" at each milestone, up until we got into Dielectric Material, where it all went very awry until I was able to sort it all out at the end. So, there are some steps in the book that didnt become tags. I did however go back and re-render all of the images once I sortedthings out. To see a list of tag names and their commit messages, type this at terminal:

`git tag -n`

To view the state of the repo at that milestone type this at terminal:

`git checkout <tagname>`

To run the program simply type this at terminal, assuming you have python3 installed:

`python3 main.py`

Enjoy. What a fun and informative project!!!
