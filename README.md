# ray-trace-in-weekend-python

This repo is my Python implemenetation of this project:

https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

The project repo is "tagged" at each milestone. To see a list of tags:

`git tag`

To view the state at that milestone type this at terminal:

`git checkout <tagname>`

To run the program simply type this at terminal, assuming you have python3 installed:

`python3 main.py`

"We better not risk another frontal assault - that rabit's dynamite!"
